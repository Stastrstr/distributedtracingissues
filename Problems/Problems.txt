1. Can't add custom dimensions using AddTags for activity tracing. How it is possbile to do? 
- the problem if API consumer has a batch request which intiate jobs with the same operationId 
that means it is not possible to distinguish activity functions inside one batch.

2. Exceptions are duplicated 
3. Distributed tracing entries don't address ITelemetryInitializer (Can't set custom role name)
4. Orchestration exceptions (during orchestration thread execution) don't set custom role name
5. Legacy Orchestration logs are pushed.
